## What Makes Aizen Agents the Best

> "A goal without a plan is just a wish." – Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

It's all about the complexity they can handle. Aizen agents break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps based on available tools. They don't just plan—they execute, adjust when necessary, report success and failure, and provide proof of work every step of the way.
