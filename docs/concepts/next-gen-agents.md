# Next Generation AI Agents

We admire Eliza and Zerepy for pioneering autonomous Web3 AI agents, focusing on social interaction across platforms. However, the next generation of AI models must be more than just talkersâ€”they need to plan and take action.

## DeFAI (Decentralized Financial AI)

DeFAI is about making AI active participants in DeFi ecosystems. These agents will:

-   Generate yield
-   Manage lending
-   Provide liquidity
-   Optimize strategies for profitable financial participation

Their ability to automate complex financial operations can significantly expand market efficiency and accessibility.

## DeScAI (Decentralized Scientific AI)

DeScAI will transform how innovation happens. These models will:

-   Analyze research
-   Propose novel ideas
-   Run experiments
-   Validate results
-   Secure funding
-   Launch new protocols

By taking on end-to-end scientific processes, they can drive discovery at an unprecedented scale.
